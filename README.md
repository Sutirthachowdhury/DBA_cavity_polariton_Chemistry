# Cavity Induced Interfering Electron Transfer Pathways for Donor(D)-Bridge(B)-Acceptor(A) Systems

**Introduction:**

Tuning chemical reactivity by coupling molecular system to a photon field in an optical cavity has emerged as an exciting method beyond the traditional paradigms of chemistry[1–13]. Theoretical investigations have played an important role in uncovering the underlying principles of the cavity quantum-
electrodynamics (cQED) process that enable new reactivities in a photon-molecule hybrid system inside an optical cavity[4–9, 11–20]. Despite encouraging progress, simulating and understanding the underlying phenomena of such molecular system that is coupled to a quantized photon mode in an optical cavity remains a challenging task. 

DBA is a prototype model for the Macromolecular Electron transfer systems such as protein complexes or DNA. The Underlying electron transfer mechanism for these DBA system occurs through the superexchange pathway or in other wotds bridge mediated pathway. In this work, we derive an empirical rate expression, similar to Fermi’s Golden Rule (FGR) rate structure in presence with an optical cavity to properly describe the donor to acceptor rate for the DBA systems. Our work demonstrated that in presence of optical cavity one can create two different pathways for electron transfer. 
    
    (A) cavity created direct transition through multiple channels between donor to acceptor which was not presentwithout cavity. 2. Through bridge   
        transitions occur with multiple cavity created channels. This new electron transfer pathways offer a very different rate profile
compare to no cavity scenario. From our rate calculation,
it can be clearly observed that by tuning the properties
of the cavity such as photon frequency or light-matter
coupling strength one can obtain both suppression and
enhancement of the reaction rate constants. This encour-
aging rate calculations predicts the new mechanisms of
electron transfer that can go beyond traditional paradigm
of chemistry and opens up new possibilities to modulate
the interference pathways by using the cavity properties   

- Note that direct Donor-acceptor overlap is not present without cavity. The charge/electron transfer can only possible through bridge. But this scenario can be changed/modulated significantly when molecule is coupled with optical cavity, which creates molecule-photon hybrid states. In the following paragraph we briefly mentioned the outcomes from this process.

- In presence of optical cavity:
    - we have new sets of direct Donor to acceptor channels (this channels are photon or light-matter hybrid states), created by cavity (cavity property)
    - As well as we have many channels between bridge (creating virtual states) assisted pathway, created unique interference pattern.
