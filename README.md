# DBA_cavity_polariton_Chemistry

- DBA is prototype model for the Macromolecular Electron transfer systems such as protein or DNA. 
- The Underlying electron transfer mechanism for these DBA system occur through the superexchange pathway or in other wotds bridge mediated pathway
- Note that direct Donor-acceptor overlap is not present, only posibility is through bridge.
- In presence of optical cavity:
-     a. we have new sets of direct Donor to acceptor channels, created by cavity (governed by cavity property)
-     b. As well as we have many channels between bridge assisted pathway, created interference pattern.

**Results:**
Results shows a very different rates compare to no-cavity scenario suggesting a strong interference pathway which takes beyond traditional paradigm of chemistry.
