** Introduction: **

Tuning chemical reactivity by coupling molecular system to a photon field in an optical cavity has emerged as an exciting method beyond the traditional paradigms of chemistry[1? –13]. Theoretical investigations have played an important role in uncovering the underlying principles of the cavity quantum-
electrodynamics (cQED) process that enable new reactivities in a photon-molecule hybrid system inside an optical cavity[4–9, 11? –20]. Despite encouraging progress, simulating accurate quantum dynamics of a molecular system that is coupled to a quantized photon mode in an optical cavity remains a challenging task.


- DBA stands for Donor-Bridge-Acceptor system, is a prototype model for the Macromolecular Electron transfer systems such as protein or DNA. 

- The Underlying electron transfer mechanism for these DBA system occurs through the superexchange pathway or in other wotds bridge mediated pathway. Important feature of this type of model system is that the energy gap between Bridge and Donor/acceptor will be larger comparing to the copuling
between Donor-Bridge or Bridge-Acceptor. Depending on Molecular geometry, one can imagine that the both Donor and Acceptor is in equal energetics or there can be energy offsets.   

- Note that direct Donor-acceptor overlap is not present without cavity. The charge/electron transfer can only possible through bridge. But this scenario can be changed/modulated significantly when molecule is coupled with optical cavity, which creates molecule-photon hybrid states. In the following paragraph we briefly mentioned the outcomes from this process.

- In presence of optical cavity:
    - we have new sets of direct Donor to acceptor channels (this channels are photon or light-matter hybrid states), created by cavity (cavity property)
    - As well as we have many channels between bridge (creating virtual states) assisted pathway, created unique interference pattern.
